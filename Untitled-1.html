        </p>The project we created was done over 4 3 day sprints and is a console app that allows a user  to interact with multiple pets within a shelter. 
        As a team we were tasked with creating the code that would allow a user to do these things. We used multiple tools throughout the process such as Eclipse,Git, and GitHub .
        We also used some others like Youtube, Stackoverflow, as well as peers and instructors.

       <p> This project was created over a one week span and split betweeb me and my partner Luke. We were tasked with creating a system that allowed for Doctors,nurses,receptions,and janitors.
           We had to track the slary and if each employee had been paid. The two of use were also tasked with creating a way to make the janitor sweep and the receptionist answer the phone.
           The last task of the project was to create a way to have the nurse and doctor draw blood from patients.

     <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Brendin Headlee and I am currently a Software Developer in training at Wecancodeit in Columbus, Ohio. Over the last two years I have fallen in love with the Tech industry and everything it brings to the table. I was born and raised in Columbus and attended Grove City Highschool with the class of 2016. My family has always been what id call “Blue Collar” which taught me how to roll up my sleeves and get my hands dirty. The skills I have learned are from my diverse background of employment and are skills that I use every day to complete tasks and reach goals.  </p>
